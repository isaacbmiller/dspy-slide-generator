Below is a one-stop set of brand, tone, and voice guidelines for DSPy—synthesized from the DSPy website, GitHub repo, and third-party write-ups. These guidelines will help keep all DSPy-related communications, documentation, and visuals feeling cohesive, modern, and unmistakably “DSPy.”

## Summary

DSPy is positioned as a **declarative**, **modular**, and **self-optimizing** framework for programming LLMs (“Programming – not prompting” LMs) ([DSPy][1]). Its logo pairs a **puzzle-piece icon** in a **vivid red** with strong **black** lettering, implying both “assembly” and “precision” . The brand voice should be **authoritative yet approachable**, speaking directly to AI practitioners who value both clarity and rigor. Visually, DSPy favors a **high-contrast**, **minimalist** palette (black, white, red), **sans-serif typography** for prose, and a **monospace font** for code snippets.

## Brand Identity

### Logo & Iconography

* **Primary Logo:** Puzzle-piece motif in **red** alongside the wordmark “DSPy” in **black** on white .
* **Designer Credit:** Logo by Chuyi Zhang ([GitHub][2]).
* **Usage:** Always surround by ample whitespace; avoid treatments that distort or recolor the puzzle icon.

### Color Palette

| Name            | Role                      | Example                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **DSPy Red**    | Accent / Calls-to-action  | `#E03B3E` (≈puzzle icon red) |
| **Pure Black**  | Primary text / logo       | `#000000`                    |
| **Clean White** | Background                | `#FFFFFF`                    |
| **Light Gray**  | Panels / code backgrounds | `#F5F5F5`                    |

### Typography

* **Headings & UI:** Modern **geometric sans-serif** (e.g. Inter, SF Pro, or Studio Feixen Sans as used on DSPy site) ([DSPy][1]).
* **Body Text:** Neutral **sans-serif** (e.g. Roboto, Helvetica Neue).
* **Code & Examples:** Monospaced (e.g. Courier New, Menlo), with a light-gray background for emphasis ([DSPy][1]).

## Tone & Voice

### Core Attributes

1. **Authoritative & Precise**

   * Explain concepts with clarity; assume readers understand AI fundamentals.
   * Use definitive language: “DSPy compiles your high-level modules into optimal prompts” ([IBM][3]).
2. **Approachable & Collaborative**

   * Write as though coaching a peer: “Let’s build a RAG pipeline in three lines of code.”
   * Use inclusive pronouns (“we,” “you”) and active voice.
3. **Concise & Action-Oriented**

   * Open docs with a TL;DR or “Getting started” snippet.
   * Favor step-by-step instructions over long paragraphs.

### Do’s & Don’ts

| Do                                                                           | Don’t                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| “Configure your LM in a single line with `dspy.configure(...)`.” ([DSPy][1]) | “One might consider setting up the language model.”   |
| “Combine modules to build agents that self-improve.”                         | “Perhaps you could explore optimizing prompts later.” |
| Use code examples liberally and highlight key parameters.                    | Overload prose with extraneous theory or digressions. |

## Imagery & Visual Language

### Style

* **Diagrams & Icons:** Line-art style, single-color (black or red) illustrations of pipelines, puzzle pieces, or flow-graphs—echoing DSPy’s modular ethos .
* **Screenshots:** Always frame with a white border on a light-gray canvas.
* **Photography:** If used, choose abstract tech-backgrounds (circuit motifs, minimal workspaces) desaturated to grayscale; overlay with red highlights sparingly.

---

## Application Examples

### Website & Docs

* Banner headline:

  > **“Programming – not prompting LMs”** ([DSPy][1])
* Subhead:

  > “DSPy is a declarative framework for building modular AI software…” ([DSPy][1])

### Social & Marketing

* **Voice:** Confident, concise—“Unlock modular AI pipelines in Python.”
* **Visual:** Logo in DSPy Red on a black or white background; use minimal text overlays.
